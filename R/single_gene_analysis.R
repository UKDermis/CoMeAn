#' Single gene and neigbourhood analysis
#' Extracts a number of values for a specific vertex (read, gene) from the graph,
#' returns a vector containing the neighborhood graph, as well as the gene's module membership,
#' node degree, and hubscore.

#' @param gene_name (Required) Strig name of the vertex that will be analyzed
